## Overview

`SettingsWidget` is a Python package for quickly creating  QT6 editors for simple configuration files. This is useful when
you don't want users to have to use a text editor for your configuration file. This is designed to work with different
format config files. An implementations for YML is included but this can be  replaced with a
module that can save and load different file formats.

## Support
This is beta software and likely to have issues.  To report an issue, please visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/corb555/YMLEditor/issues).

## Features

**SettingsWidget** provides a Widget for displaying and editing fields based on the supplied layout. You
simply list the fields with their config key and the widget you want for them (line_edit, text_edit, label,
combo-box). You can also add a regex for data entry validation. The SettingsWiget and YamlConfig  will
read the
config file, display the fields for editing and then save the data.

- **Easy Front-End Creation:** Create a configuration editor for files with a few lines of code.
- **Configurable Layout:** Displays settings in a grid layout based the format you provide.
- **Widget Support:** Supports these input widgets: text edit, line edit, combo box, and label.
- **Input Validation:** Validates input based on specified rules (e.g., regular expressions) and 
highlights invalid entries.
- **Data Syncing:** Synchronizes data values between the UI and the config file, seamlessly using the
  ConfigFile manager described below.
- **Utilizes PyQt6**

**YamlConfig** provides functionality for creating, loading, updating, and saving YAML files.

- **Load / Save / Create** Provides interfaces to load and save YAML files and to create new YAML files.
- **Get / Set Operations:** Provides simple key/value access to data fields in the YAML configuration. Including
scalars (int, float, str), lists, and dictionaries.  _Complex  hierarchies are not supported._
- **Undo Support:** Keeps a snapshot for each save in session and restores from stack.
- **Granular Dependency Management:** For build system integration, this can be configured to touch a proxy file 
when specified fields change, offering more granular dependency tracking for build systems.

## Installation

To install `YMLEditor`:

```bash
pip install configeditor
```

### Format Layout

Each line in the format corresponds to a field in the config file with layout
attributes:  
`config_key: (DisplayName, WidgetType, Options, Width)`

- config_Key: The name of the item in the config file
- Display Name: The name to show in the UI for the field.
- Widget Type: The type of input control "text_edit", "line_edit", "label", "read_only", or "combo_box".
- Valid Options: Either a regex pattern for field validation (e.g., line_edit), 
       or a list of items for selection (e.g., combo box).
- Field Width: Width of the widget in the UI.

### Sample layout format

```python
formats = {
       "layout1": {
              "TIP": ("Tip Amount", "line_edit", r'^\d{1,2}%?$', 50),
              "DESSERT": ("Dessert", "combo", ["Tiramisu", "Apple Tart", "Cheesecake"], 200),
              "SITES.B": ("Location B", "line_edit", None, 180), "SITES": ("Sites", "line_edit", None, 300),
       },
}
```

### Sample YML file

```yaml
DESSERT: Cheesecake
TIP: 18
SITES:
  A: New Orleans
  B: Boston
  C: Vancouver
  ```
